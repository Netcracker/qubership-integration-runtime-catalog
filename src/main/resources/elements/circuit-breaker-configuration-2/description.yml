    - name: failureRateThreshold
      title: Failure rate threshold (%)
      description: Configures the failure rate threshold in percentage. If the failure rate is equal or greater than the threshold the CircuitBreaker transitions to open and starts short-circuiting calls. The threshold must be greater than 0 and not greater than 100.
      type: number
      mandatory: true
      default: 50
      autofocus: true
    - name: permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState
      title: Permitted number of calls in half open state
      description: Configures the number of permitted calls when the CircuitBreaker is half open. The size must be greater than 0
      type: number
      mandatory: true
      default: 10
    - name: slidingWindowSize
      title: Sliding window size
      description: Configures the size of the sliding window which is used to record the outcome of calls when the CircuitBreaker is closed. Sliding window can either be count-based or time-based. If slidingWindowType is COUNT_BASED, the last slidingWindowSize calls are recorded and aggregated. If slidingWindowType is TIME_BASED, the calls of the last slidingWindowSize seconds are recorded and aggregated. If the "Sliding window type" is COUNT_BASED, the "Minimum number of calls" cannot be greater than "Sliding window size"

      allowedValues:
        - COUNT_BASED
        - TIME_BASED
      mandatory: false
      default: COUNT_BASED
    - name: minimumNumberOfCalls
      title: Minimum number of calls
      description: Configures the minimum number of calls which are required (per sliding window period) before the CircuitBreaker can calculate the error rate. For example, if "Minimum number of calls" is 10, then at least 10 calls must be recorded, before the failure rate can be calculated. If only 9 calls have been recorded the CircuitBreaker will not transition to open even if all 9 calls have failed
      type: number
      mandatory: true
      default: 100
    - name: waitDurationInOpenState
      title: Wait duration in open state (s)
      description: Configures the wait duration (in seconds) which specifies how long the CircuitBreaker should stay open, before it switches to half open
      type: number
      mandatory: true
      default: 60
    - name: automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled
      title: Automatic transition from open to half open state
      description: Enables automatic transition from OPEN to HALF_OPEN state once the "Wait duration in open state" has passed
      type: boolean
      default: false
    - name: slowCallDurationThreshold
      title: Slow call duration threshold (s)
      description: Configures the duration threshold (seconds) above which calls are considered as slow and increase the slow calls percentage
      type: number
      mandatory: true
      default: 60
    - name: slowCallRateThreshold
      title: Slow call rate threshold (%)
      description: Configures a threshold in percentage. The CircuitBreaker considers a call as slow when the call duration is greater than "Slow call duration threshold" duration. When the percentage of slow calls is equal or greater the threshold, the CircuitBreaker transitions to open and starts short-circuiting calls
      type: number
      mandatory: true
      default: 100
